Basics and Structure

	The database first prompts the user to enter a command, with a list of commands being available under help, which is a possibility shown to the user. After a command is entered, the user is then able to do everything necessary after, with the guidance of the CLI. For sake of simplicity, all of the files and the code are listed within the same directory. The code for the project is listed under ProBallDatabase.py
